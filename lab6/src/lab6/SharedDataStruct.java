//This file defines class "SharedDataStruct", a shared data structure which is
//accessed by reader and writer threads.
//
//In this small example, the "shared data" consists of a single integer.
//This integer is declared to be private to class SharedData.  The only
//way for readers and writers to access this integer is by calling the
//data access methods "dataRead" and "dataWrite". The reader/writer 
//synchronization is built into the data access methods.  (The implementation
//of dataRead and dataWrite uses calls to the rw monitor, to provide
//synchronization.)
//
//From the outside, the reader and writer threads using the SharedData
//class do not need to be aware that there is any synchronization going on.
//This is a "safe" way to organize the software, with no chance that a
//reader or writer could access the data illegally.  For example, it is
//impossible for a reader to "forget to call startRead". The only way a 
//reader can access the shared data is via method "dataRead".  If the reader
//tries to access dataValue directly, a compile-time error results, since
//dataValue is declared to be private.
//
//In a more realistic example, a complex data structure would be declared
//instead of the integer dataValue.  This complex data structure (still 
//declared "private") would be accessed via set of data access methods, with
//one data access method for each type of update or value-retireval that 
//can be done.
//
//The data access methods (dataRead and dataWrite) use sleep statements 
//to simulate the time taken to access a complex database.  This allows
//us to observe the synchronization between readers and writers.

//This code uses class rwMonitor.

public class SharedDataStruct {
 // For this small example, the "shared data" consists of a single integer
 private int dataValue;  


 // Declare an instance of the reader-writer monitor, to synchronize access
 // to dataValue.  If several instances of SharedDataStruct are created
 // (e.g. in mainMethod), then each of these data structures has its own 
 // instance of the reader-writer monitor.  That way, the synchronization
 // for "access to data structure number one" is not affected by 
 // synchornization for access to "data structure number two".

 public SharedDataStruct() {
     dataValue = 0;     // Initialize the "shared data"

 }  // end of the constructor for class SharedDataStruct


 // ---------------------  Data Access Methods ----------------------------
 // The dataWrite method changes the value of some part of the shared
 // data.  In this small example, the integer value is updated.
 // A sleep statement simulates the time taken to update shared data that
 // has a more complicated structure.

                     // updated".  No reader should ever see this value.
   try { Thread.sleep((int)(200*Math.random()+1)); } catch(Exception e) { }
   dataValue = value;
   rw.endWrite();
}  // end of the dataWrite method



 // The dataRead method reads some part of the shared data.  In this small
 // example, the integer value is read.
 // A sleep statement simulates the time taken to access shared data that
 // has a more complicated structure.  Reading takes half as long as writing.
 public int dataRead () {
     int value;  // the value read from the shared data.
